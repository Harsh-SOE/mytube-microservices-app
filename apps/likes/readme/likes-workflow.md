ðŸ”¹ How to model it in Redis

Instead of only one set, youâ€™ll maintain two sets per video:

video:likes:{videoId} â†’ users who liked

video:dislikes:{videoId} â†’ users who disliked

And still keep sharded counters for scalability:

video:likes:count:{videoId}:{shard}

video:dislikes:count:{videoId}:{shard}

ðŸ”¹ Operations

1. Like

SREM video:dislikes:{videoId} userId (remove from dislikes if present)

SADD video:likes:{videoId} userId

If return = 1 â†’ increment likes counter shard

If user was removed from dislikes â†’ decrement dislikes counter shard

2. Unlike

SREM video:likes:{videoId} userId

If return = 1 â†’ decrement likes counter shard

3. Dislike

SREM video:likes:{videoId} userId (remove from likes if present)

SADD video:dislikes:{videoId} userId

If return = 1 â†’ increment dislikes counter shard

If user was removed from likes â†’ decrement likes counter shard

4. Undislike

SREM video:dislikes:{videoId} userId

If return = 1 â†’ decrement dislikes counter shard

ðŸ”¹ Why this works

No double likes/dislikes â†’ sets guarantee uniqueness.

No like + dislike at the same time â†’ explicit removal from opposite set.

Scalability â†’ counters are sharded; you donâ€™t need to scan sets for counts.

Durability â†’ you can periodically flush Redis sets to a DB for persistence.
